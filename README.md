# DPOC-Project
Programming Exercise of the course Dynamic Programming and Optimal Control, ETH Zurich, academic year 2019/2020. Read ProgrammingExercise.pdf for problem and scripts description. The aim of this programming exercise is to solve a stochastic shortest path problem using Value Iteration, Policy Iteration and Linear Programming. The scripts coded by the student are:

1. ComputeTerminalStateIndex.m
2. ComputeTransitionProbabilities.m
3. ComputeStageCosts.m
4. PolicyIteration.m
5. ValueIteration.m
6. LinearProgramming.m

Run main.m for checking the solution obtained.
